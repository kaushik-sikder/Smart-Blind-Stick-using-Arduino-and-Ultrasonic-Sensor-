# **üö∂‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è Smart Blind Stick Project Repository**

This project demonstrates how to build a simple yet effective Smart Blind Stick using an Arduino and an ultrasonic sensor. The system provides buzzer and LED alerts that vary their rate based on the distance to nearby obstacles, helping visually impaired individuals navigate more safely and independently.

---

## **üìù Project Overview**

The Smart Blind Stick uses an ultrasonic sensor to measure the distance between the stick and potential obstacles. Based on the proximity of objects, it provides different alert signals:

* A **buzzer** beeps faster as the object gets closer.  
* An **LED** blinks with increasing frequency as the distance decreases.

An Arduino board processes the sensor data and triggers the appropriate alerts, making this a practical and accessible DIY automation project.

This project helps you gain hands-on experience with:

* **Ultrasonic sensor interfacing**  
* **Arduino programming**  
* **Buzzer and LED control based on sensor data**  
* **Simple embedded system design**

## **‚öôÔ∏è Installation and Setup**

### **1\. Clone the Repository:**

git clone [**https://github.com/YogeshwaranP-05/Arduino-Smart-walking-stick.git**](https://github.com/YogeshwaranP-05/Arduino-Smart-walking-stick.git)  
cd [**Arduino-Smart-walking-stick**](https://github.com/YogeshwaranP-05/Arduino-Smart-walking-stick)

### **2\. Connect Components:**

* Connect the ultrasonic sensor to the digital pins of the Arduino.  
* Connect the buzzer and LED to the Arduino with appropriate resistors.  
* Power up the system with a 9V supply.

### **3\. Upload the Code:**

* Open **Smart-stick`.ino`** in the Arduino IDE.  
* Select the appropriate board and COM port.  
* Upload the code to your Arduino.

### **4\. Run the System:**

* Hold the stick and point the ultrasonic sensor towards obstacles.  
* The **buzzer** and **LED** will react based on the distance detected.

## **üìù Code Explanation**

* **Distance Measurement**: The ultrasonic sensor sends out pulses and measures the time taken for the echo to return.  
* **Proximity Detection**: The code calculates the distance and categorizes it into different ranges.  
* **Alert System**:  
  * **Buzzer** beeps faster as obstacles get closer.  
  * **LED** blinks more rapidly with decreasing distance.
